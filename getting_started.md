Fantastic, and welcome!

`ensime-server` is a process that indexes your dependencies and understands your source code using the same [scalac](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/docs/compiler/index.html#scala.tools.nsc.interactive.package) and [javac](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jdk/api/javac/tree/) that you use to build your project.

ENSIME is not an IDE, it is just one tool in a toolbox. You must also have:

1. a build tool to compile your project
1. a `.ensime` file describing your project layout. To generate this file, see [our list of build tool plugins](/build_tools/).
1. a text editor. See [our list of editor plugins](/editors/).

The build tool plugin downloads the `ensime-server` and your text editor launches it. Read the [server documentation](/server) to further customise your experience.
